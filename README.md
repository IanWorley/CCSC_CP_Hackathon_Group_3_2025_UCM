## Laundry in College 
I hate it, you hate it, we all hate it. From people leaving their clothes for hours on end, to never knowing if a machine is open until you haul yourself and all of your stuff to the laundry room; looking like an idiot with a pile of dirty clothes you've been letting sit for far too long at washers that are all taken and still have a half hour or more left in them, it is not a fun endeavor to take on. While we're not going to be able to make it more enjoyable, we are going to be able to make it more manageable and easier to time. 
## The Vision 
What if colleges had an actual good way to check on washers and dryers available or how much time was left so you didn't have to guesstimate or set a timer and hope you get there in time to take over the person after you. What f you didn't have to do any of that and you could just reserve a washer and dryer ahead of time and avoid all these troubles entirely? That would be great right? That's where we come in with WashUCM
