## Laundry in College 
I hate it, you hate it, we all hate it. From people leaving their clothes for hours on end, to never knowing if a machine is open until you haul yourself and all of your stuff to the laundry room; looking like an idiot with a pile of dirty clothes you've been letting sit for far too long at washers that are all taken and still have a half hour or more left in them, it is not a fun endeavor to take on. While we're not going to be able to make it more enjoyable, we are going to be able to make it more manageable and easier to time. 
## The Vision 
What if colleges had an actual useful and innovative way to check on the washers and dryers available in your building, or how much time was left so you didn't have to guesstimate or even worse set a timer on the hope you get there in time to take over the person after you. That would be great right? That's where we come in with WashUCM
## The Project 
Our project is a Vite React front end progressive web app, with a python based flask backend RESTful API. UCM students can register an account, select the building they reside in, 
and check on the status of the laundry machines that they live in. Students are even given the ability to reserve a machine currently in use so that they have first dips 
once the machine finishes its current load.
